## Showcase

### [Gonfique Playground](https://github.com/ufukty/gonfique-playground)

[![Screenshot of Gonfique Playground](assets/gp.png)](https://github.com/ufukty/gonfique-playground)

Gonfique Playground brings Gonfique to browsers. It is a web app that works on Monaco editor and Golang WASM to give developers an extremely reactive development environment where they can see the result of their changes in input file and Gonfique config in real time. The project is written in TypeScript and built with Vite to static files. Still works offline.

### [Gonfique](https://github.com/ufukty/gonfique)

[![Gonfique logo](assets/gonfique.png)](https://github.com/ufukty/gonfique)

Offline and customizable YAML and JSON to Go for those who are not satisfied with the most popular [Mholt's JSON-to-Go](https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/). Pre-alpha of 2nd version brings new features like overriding resolved type expression, implementing struct iterators, providing option between struct and map representation for JSON/YAML objects, assigning parent refs on nodes; and improves existing features like auto generated type names by picking the shortest semantically correct name that doesn't collide with others, importing external packages for type replacement.

### [Dim](https://github.com/ufukty/dim)

[![Dim logo](assets/dim.png)](https://github.com/ufukty/dim)

A Visual Studio Code extension that reduces the opacity of matching statements and expressions to make the main logic pop. Intended for pushing the Go's error wrapping blocks and JS's logging lines to a little behind.

### [ovpn-auth](https://github.com/ufukty/ovpn-auth)

Basic authentication for OpenVPN server; supports time-based one-time-pads as well as password check and uses argon2 for hashes.

### [Reddit Galaxy (2021)](https://github.com/ufukty/reddit-galaxy)

Connection of subreddits represented with shared links between them. Linker end is orange, linked end is blue. Made with Apache Spark, Python, matplotlib

### [Diffusion of Innovation simulation (2020)](https://github.com/ufukty/diffusion-of-innovation)

Diffusion of a fake innovation is inspected in different community types while members promote from initial state to confirmation through 6 other states; s-curve on adoption and the role of higher-degree nodes are observed. Made with Python, matplotlib, NetworkX
