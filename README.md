### [Gonfique Playground](https://github.com/ufukty/gonfique-playground)

[![Screenshot of Gonfique Playground](assets/gp.png)](https://github.com/ufukty/gonfique-playground)

Gonfique Playground brings Gonfique to the browser. It is a web app built on the Monaco editor and Golang WASM, providing an extremely responsive development environment where you can see the results of changes to the input file and Gonfique config in real time. Written in TypeScript and built with Vite to produce static files, it still works offline.

### [Gonfique](https://github.com/ufukty/gonfique)

[![Gonfique logo](assets/gonfique.png)](https://github.com/ufukty/gonfique)

An offline, customizable tool that generates Go code for YAML or JSON files, designed for those seeking an alternative to Mholt’s JSON-to-Go. The pre-alpha of version 2 introduces new features such as overriding resolved type expressions, implementing struct iterators, providing a choice between struct or map representations for JSON/YAML objects, and assigning parent references to nodes. It also improves existing capabilities, such as auto-generated type names that avoid collisions by choosing the shortest semantically valid name, and importing external packages for type replacement.

### [Dim](https://github.com/ufukty/dim)

[![Dim logo](assets/dim.png)](https://github.com/ufukty/dim)

A Visual Studio Code extension that reduces the opacity of matching statements and expressions to help the main logic stand out. Originally intended for pushing Go’s error-wrapping blocks and JavaScript logging lines slightly into the background.

### [ovpn-auth](https://github.com/ufukty/ovpn-auth)

Provides basic authentication for an OpenVPN server. It supports TOTP-based codes and password checks and uses Argon2 to handle hashing securely.

### [Reddit Galaxy (2021)](https://github.com/ufukty/reddit-galaxy)

Shows the connections between subreddits based on shared links; one end of the link is orange, the other is blue. Built with Apache Spark, Python, and Matplotlib.

### [Diffusion of Innovation simulation (2020)](https://github.com/ufukty/diffusion-of-innovation)

Simulates the spread of a hypothetical innovation in different types of communities, where members progress through seven states (from initial awareness to confirmation). Observes the resulting s-curve of adoption and the role of high-degree nodes. Created using Python, Matplotlib, and NetworkX.

### [ball-and-stick-man (2016)](https://github.com/ufukty/ball-and-stick-man)

A basic 3D demonstration with a movable camera, animated arms, a “tour” mode, and waving interactions. Created with C++ and OpenGL (GLUT).

### [Poor Man's Social Media (2016,2024)](https://github.com/ufukty/poor-man-s-social-media)

A PHP-based application that processes AJAX calls to an API and provides a straightforward frontend for user interaction with JavaScript.
